This is a simple extension I made for myself to conveniently watch movies in an online cinema. 
The problem was that my laptop often lacked sufficient volume levels. 
Similar extensions are available in the Google Chrome Web Store, but they require suspicious permissions during installation, which I don't understand, so I decided not to take the risk and implemented all the functionality myself. 
Additionally, I added the ability to detach the video into a separate window, as this feature is sometimes needed but often not provided in the player.
